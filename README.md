# Final_Project
This repository contains a collection of final project submissions.

### 2024 presentation schedule
The teams for the final project and their presentation time are as follows:

|Group 3|Anthony, Calida, Stellan|11h20 - 11h50|

Please arrive 5min before your alloted time slot so we can start promptly. Lateness will not be tolerated and entering during another team's presentation is forbidden - will result in a penalty for **your team's** final grade. 

### Submission guidelines
The written submission must be submitted latest by the end of the oral examination, aka. 12pm, 25 March 2024.

The code and presentation slides must be submitted into the 2024 folder. Alternatively, if you are planning to create a startup with the presented idea or otherwise cannot publicize your work, please put your code and slides into a private repository and add me as a collaborator.
